**Netflix Data Analysis with MySQL**

**Project Overview**

This project explores and analyzes a dataset of Netflix titles using MySQL, providing insights into content trends, regional distribution, genres, directors, actors, and audience ratings. 

_The aim is to showcase the ability to perform data cleaning, querying, and analytical insights on real-world streaming platform data, which is essential for a Data Analyst portfolio._

**The dataset contains information such as:**

--> Show ID, Type (Movie/TV Show), Title, Director, Cast, Country

--> Date Added, Release Year, Rating, Duration, Genres, Description

**Objectives**

--> Explore Netflix content trends over time.

--> Analyze genre, rating, and country-wise distributions.

--> Identify top-performing actors and directors.

--> Perform business-driven analysis for content strategy and audience insights.

--> Demonstrate intermediate-to-advanced SQL techniques including joins, aggregation, window functions, and subqueries.

**Tools & Technologies**

--> Database: MySQL

--> Querying: SQL (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, JOIN, WINDOW FUNCTIONS, CTEs)

--> Optional Visualization: Power BI / Tableau / Excel (for dashboards)

**Key Analyses & Insights**

--> Some example insights derived from the dataset:

  --> Total number of movies vs TV shows and yearly trends.
  
  --> Most popular genres and genre combinations.
  
  --> Top countries producing Netflix content.
  
  --> Directors and actors with the highest number of appearances.
  
  --> Average duration of movies and TV shows per genre.
  
  --> Age rating distribution and content trends over time.
  
  --> Month-over-month and year-over-year additions for Netflix content.


**Learning Outcomes**

--> Gain hands-on experience in SQL data analysis for real-world datasets.

--> Develop skills in data aggregation, filtering, and subquery analysis.

--> Create actionable insights from a business analytics perspective.

--> Build a portfolio-ready project showcasing both SQL querying and analytical thinking.



**Next Steps**

Connect the MySQL database to Power BI or Tableau for interactive dashboards.

Perform sentiment or textual analysis on the description column using Python or R.
